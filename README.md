## Description
This project was created as part of a programming course, serving as a simple static landing page to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills. The objective was to build a basic website and gain hands-on experience in web development.

The landing page is designed with a clean and minimalistic layout, featuring options on the left side and a content section.

## Content Section
The content section is divided into two parts using a grid layout.

### Left Side
The left side of the content section displays four square tiles, each representing different categories or services:

- News
- About Us
- Services
- Contact

### Right Side
The right side of the content section presents a step-by-step guide on how to publish a home page.

1. **Step 1: Domain Name Registration**
   - Explain the importance of choosing a domain name and how it affects search engine results and website visitors.
   - Mention the options for registering domain names through the NIC website or contacting registrars for assistance and support.

2. **Step 2: Selecting a Maintenance Company (Hosting Provider)**
   - Highlight the significance of hosting for making a website accessible to internet users.
   - Mention the criteria to consider when choosing a hosting service provider:
      - Service price
      - Availability and quality of operation
      - Server speed
      - Capacity
      - Security

3. **Step 3: Data Placement on the Hosting Server**
   - Explain that all website files and software must be placed on the hosting server, typically in the "/www/yourdomain" folder.
   - Recommend using the recommended structure and leaving the domain directory ("Root folder") on "auto" when creating the domain name.

4. **Step 4: Home Page Maintenance**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly adding new information to prevent the website from becoming outdated.
   - Suggest maintenance practices, such as updating the website with new content at least once a month, engaging in advertising efforts, and sharing news in social networks and interest groups.


The footer is positioned outside the main content area, enclosed in a blue square with rounded edges, and contains additional footer information.

The landing page aims to prioritize simplicity, making it an ideal starting point for beginners to understand HTML, CSS, and grid layout concepts.
